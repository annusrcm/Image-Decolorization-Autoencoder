This is an Autoencoder based neural network which converts rgb images into gray scale.

Configuration
config.py contains all the paths and configuration


For Preprocessing
preprocess_data.py : It takes in colored image as input and saves the resized colored image and respective gray
scale image.


Training and Prediction
train_and_test.py: Training is done using autoencoder, model will be stored and for testing images, gray scale image
will be generated and stored in specified folder.

Folders:
path : Location of training images
color_path :  Location of resized colored training images
grap_path : Location of gray training images
test_data_path : Location of testing images
test_gray_path : Location of actual gray testing images
test_output : Location of gray images generated by trained model
model_folder : Location where model will get stored

Data:
For training data is taken from : http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz
It contains 3670 images of flowers, 5 folders for 5 types if flowers

For testing data is taken from :  https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/the-dataset-of-flower-images/data
It contains one folder which has images of 210 flowers.

RUN:
Install the requirements by running the setup file:
1. sh setup.sh requirements.txt
2. Change the name of folders in config.py
3. sh rgb_to_gray.sh
